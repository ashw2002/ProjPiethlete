Hello!  Thank yo for checking out Average Ohio Tuesday!

The game is a small scale tower defense game made by Ash and Ted.  

Its not what we were aiming for, but for a couple of amatures learning a completely new engine, I think it turned out pretty alright.

The main clarifications I want to make are about the enemies,  you will encounter 5 in total

Regular crows are small black birds that won't take too much punishment before you can shoot them down.

Fat Crows have double the health of regular crows

Metal Shiny Crows take Half Physical damage, so having at least one wizard scarecrow is a good idea when you can afford it.  

Yellow Glowie crows are fast and resist magic damage, so don't spam too many wizards or these guys are going to fly straight through.

Fat metal crows also exist, they're just the tankiest of the crows.

I'll admit, I have no idea how balanced this game is as I kinda rushed it in the end, but should you decompile this project (or check out the github here:https://github.com/ashw2002/ProjPiethlete),
then there are JSON files that should be pretty straight forward in the scripts folder.  

Thank you very much for giving us a shot!
